# Java Learning Project

This repository contains Java programming exercises and examples for learning purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different days of learning, with each day focusing on specific concepts and exercises.

### Day 1
Currently includes:
- **Reverse a Number Program**: A program that takes a number as input and returns its reverse.

## Programs

### 1. Reverse a Number
**File**: `day1/reverseAnumber.java`

This program demonstrates:
- Taking user input using Scanner class
- Number manipulation using modulo and division operators
- While loop implementation
- Basic I/O operations

#### How it works:
1. Takes an integer input from the user
2. Uses modulo operation to extract digits
3. Builds the reversed number using mathematical operations
4. Displays the reversed result

## How to Run

1. Compile Java files:
```bash
javac day1/*.java
```
